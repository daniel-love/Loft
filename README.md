Loft
====

A simple HTML/CSS boilerplate with a hint of JavaScript.

What's Loft?
----

We're not just jumping on the bandwagon trying to make the next Bootstrap or a standard template to sell. We're just fed up of re-writing the same things for projects, spending hours thinking of how big our headings will be or looking for that simple JS script that we used before but forgot to bookmark.

So we made Loft, it's a simple compilation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript made by ourselfs (except the CSS reset) which we can use to jump start projects.

It's not designed to copy and paste snippets to get that UI of your basic script or admin panel for your mates website, it's simply stick the CSS in, hook it up and add your own styles. We like to see it as a starting point for websites. At least thats what I'll be using for.

More to follow in the coming weeks.
