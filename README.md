Loft
====

A simple HTML/CSS boilerplate with a hint of JavaScript.

*Why Loft?*
----

We created Loft because of the amount of frameworks and boilerplates that already exists with little to no... uniqueness? So many frameworks are used and kept the same out of the box. This leads to a lot of sites looking the same. Which we find absolutely disgusting. Loft instead isn't a framework, but rather a simple but lovely foundation to help ease you into designing that next sexy web project of yours.
