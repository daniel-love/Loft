# Loft

A simple HTML/CSS boilerplate with a hint of JavaScript.

## What's Loft?

We're not jumping on the bandwagon and trying to make the next Bootstrap, because we don't want that. What we're doing is making something to make our lives easier. We're fed up of rewriting the same styles and the same JavaScript for projects.

So we made Loft. It's a collection of CSS and JS which will (hopfully) help to jump start your projects.

You'll notice our stylesheet is mostly built up of basic styles, we've not added any pretty styles or anything like that (apart from a few elements), so all you have to do is place the files in your project, add your own styles to `s.css` you're done!

## Getting Started

Add the style sheet to the head section (make sure you add 	`r.css` for the reset!):

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="s.css" type="text/css" />
```
  
Then add your JavaScript (preferably at the bottom):

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/vendor/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/loft.min.js"></script>
```
Then open up `s.css` and add your styles!
